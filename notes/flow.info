### Flow information

1. Demonstrate Azure Sentinel Data Collectors - how to configure them, how to enable them and how to use them

2. Demonstrate the Azure Sentinel Github - explain the process here 
(https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Solutions#guide-to-building-microsoft-sentinel-solutions) 
and where to start (depends on what you want to do: https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/wiki#get-started-now)

3. Show different methods of connecting to data 
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/create-custom-connector#compare-custom-connector-methods) 
and what you need to do to connect - demonstrate the logic app and powershell as an example with log analytics API

4. Move to custom connectors with serverless approach and code (to demonstrate how to leverage calls to our own API) 
- show the coded solution and explain what is needed to make this to happen.

5. Demonstrate how what needs to be done in Partner Center to publish the solution 
(check solution template - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/plan-azure-app-solution-template).

6. Explain the procedure to be added in Azure Sentinel and what tools to use:
	
   a. https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/tree/master/Tools/Create-Azure-Sentinel-Solution/V2
   
7. leverage best practices in Azure to demonstrate what to be aware of.
